# Atlant Terminal
Targetted for Windows power users. If you aren't one, you won't find any benefit in this. However it would be nice if you starred :)

Linux will not be supported, some linux commands will.<br/>
Example commands include: <code>atlant a-dw git</code> (Installs git onto your system, a-dw means Atlant-Download), <code>atlant c-dw https://github.com/PetrTech/Atlant-Terminal/archive/refs/tags/source-1.zip %appdata%</code> (Downloads the source code onto your system into %appdata% (Appdata/Roaming), c-dw means Custom-Download), <code>atlant unzip %appdata%/source-1.zip</code> (Unzips the source code zip)
